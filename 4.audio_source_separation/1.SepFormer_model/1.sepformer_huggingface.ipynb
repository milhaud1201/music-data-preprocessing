    "This repository provides all the necessary tools to perform audio source separation with a SepFormer model, implemented with SpeechBrain, and pretrained on WSJ0-2Mix dataset. For a better experience we encourage you to learn more about SpeechBrain. The model performance is 22.4 dB on the test set of WSJ0-2Mix dataset.\n",
